# 🛸 Captain A – Dodge Responsibility 🚀  

A **2D space adventure** where you play as **Captain A**, the legendary hero who…  
actually prefers **dodging responsibility** rather than saving the day!  
  
Instead of being a fearless commander, **Captain A flies around dodging enemies, asteroids, and laser beams**, hoping someone else will do the hard work.  

---

## 🎮 Gameplay  
- **Move Captain A's spaceship** with arrow keys or WASD.  
- **Dodge everything** – responsibility, enemies, asteroids.  
- **Survive as long as possible** while pretending to be useful.  
- **Collect power-ups** to make dodging even easier.
